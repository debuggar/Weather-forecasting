# Weather-forecasting

This application shows change in weather. It shows the change in temperature with time. It has also a custom REST Api which gives
minimum and maximum temperature at the time of occurrence. 

In this application I have used Spring boot, Hibernate, and MySQL on backend. OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch raw data and 
Chart.js library to make graph.
